First cube is the part 1 tutorial cube. I haven't changed anything.
Middle cube is the part 1 cube that I made. I added an emmisive attribute that creates multiple shades of orange.
Right cube is the part 2 tutorial cube. I changed the colors to shades of pink. 

I was unable to finish the second half of part 2.
